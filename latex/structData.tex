\subsection{Detailed Description}
contains the info for the Wi\+Fi interface

I preferred for the sake of readability to avoid using functions and void$\ast$ type pointer to try force generic programming in C, albeit possible and much more OO, the code was really unreadable and cleaned it up resorting to more student-\/like A\+D\+Ts. It supports only one address per interface and only one S\+S\+ID per interface. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
\hyperlink{mod__wifi_8h}{mod\+\_\+wifi.\+h}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
